# touying-template
- Touying template for academic presentations.
- You can use [touying-exporter](https://github.com/touying-typ/touying-exporter) to export Typst source files to PPTX or HTML formats.
  - I had thought that speaker notes added with `#pdfpc.speaker-note()` could only be used with pdfpc, but it seems they are properly added even when exported as PPTX using touying-exporter. Therefore, there is no need to use pdfpc solely for the purpose of using speaker notes!
- You can also use [polylux2pdfpc](https://polylux.dev/book/external/pdfpc.html) to add speaker notes for pdfpc presentations.
